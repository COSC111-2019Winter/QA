# QA

1. For formatting code, what makes a program not legal and how do we avoid this?
> This is a big question. We need a semester to learn it ;-) The first step is finding the error (if the program is not legal) which we did in lecture 1/17. *Formatting* actually has a more specific meaning in programming: change the format of the code but keep the program legal and do not change what the program does.

2. In general, most of the spaces in source code are for aesthetic and understanding purposes right? Is there a specific way we have to format code for this class?
> yes and yes. For the second question, in this class, every ";" should be followed by a newline. Every "{", "}" that is after ```for```, ```while```, ```if```, class name, method name, (may be updated), should be followed by a newline. After you finish, or in the middle of the coding, you always do auto-indent in BlueJ to auto-format your code. Before you submit, do auto-indent your code. If your code is not properly formatted, I will reject your submission.

3. What are the differences between IDEs? What makes one better than another?
> will be answered later. It could start a war among programmers.

4. Are there more escape codes than the ones listed? 
> yes. normally, I would search for escape codes when I need them. Just remember ```\``` is a very special character in programming.

5. What is a method call?
> we will cover it in Chapter 4 (sorry that, sometimes, these terms just like English to me.)

6. What is the purpose of using ```public static void main(String [] args)```? And when making new programs, will ```String[] args``` be changed to something else?
> if we use this, main method can be run directly. You will learn what is ```public```, ```static``` in 211. In this class, for main method, it will always be ```public static void main(String [] args)```.

7. What is comput jargon?
> every chapter, ThinkJava will have a section, Vocabulary, to list a lot of terms of computer science. These are jargons. 

8. What is executable?
> something that can be executed.

9. Many people argued that writing code with a text editor is very helpful for beginners. Why is text editor is helpful?
> do you think the assignment of running java in terminal helped you understand a little bit more about computers in general and programming in general?

10. When are spaces optional and rquired in Java programs? Are spaces sometimes used to make the program easier to read?
> Spaces are optional most time. And they are very important to make the program easier to read. Everytime, you are not sure, try remove or add a space, and compile the program and see, whether BlueJ gives you an error or not.

11. What does IDE stand for?
> Integrated Development Environment
